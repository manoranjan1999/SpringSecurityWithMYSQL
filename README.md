# SpringSecurityWithMYSQL
Only Java code for springsecurity with MYSQL.

In this perticular project, session based authentication is used with spring inbuilt form based login.

So first run the project, then check the mysql database for a user table. Then manually add some users with some specific role into it.(As not integrated with any front-end technology)

Then try to login with the same username and password in "user" table.
